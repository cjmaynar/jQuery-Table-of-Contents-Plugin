<h1>jQuery Table of Contents Generator</h1>
<p>I want to work on a jQuery plugin, since I've not done one of those before, and it seems like something that might come up in a job interview, or for a freelance client. I've also always wanted to be able to add a table of contents to a document I've written in HTML.</p>

<h2>What It Should Do</h2>
<p>I want the script to be able to look through a set of nodes/HTML header tags, take it's title, and add it to a contents div which it creates where the user asks.</p>

<p>Each subheading should be listed too, indented each time.</p>

<p>The listing should all be links to the appropriate part of the page, so it will need to add anchor names to each of the H# tags too.</p>

<h3>How It Should Do It</h3>
<p>The first job will be to make a tree of objects, like this:</p>
<pre>
	header = {
		string name;
		header children[];
	}
</pre>

<p>To get this, we'll have to recursively iterate over each element of the page...</p>

<h2>Future expansions</h2>
<p>In the future I want to make a Wordpress addon which automatically does this for posts which have a certain shorttag in.</p>

<p>I'd also like to make a bookmarklet, so you can make a table of contents on whatever page you like.</p>
